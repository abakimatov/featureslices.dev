## Usage

In that examples TypeScript used as common language, but you free to choose.

### Applications

## Introduction

FeatureSlices define your frontend application structure as easy and convenient.

### Structure

Source code of the application contained in `src`:

- `api`
- `features`
- `lib`
- `pages`
- `ui`

#### Api

This is reusable functions or classes to make requests to the server. It is can be REST-like, GraphQL, WebSocket, etc.

Code in the `api` can be partially generated (swagger or OpenAPI).

What is API:

```
src/
  api/
    namespace.ts
    request.ts
```

For example `namespace` is a group of requests, having a common purpose. More that one namespace can be created.

Not recommended to add `src/api/index.ts` file, because different api should be separated one from one. If you import `api/user`, you see just requests related to user. But if you import `api`, you can be drowned in tons of requests for application.

Example:

```
src/
  api/
    post.ts
    feed.ts
    session.ts
    request.ts
```

In this example: `post`, `feed`, `session` is a namespaced requests, but `request` is a base function, to make requests.

Example `post.ts`:

```ts
import { request } from './request'

interface PostNew {
  title: string;
  content: string;
}

export const postsList = () => request({ method: "GET", path: "/posts" })

export const postCreate = (post: PostNew) => request({ method: "POST", path: "/posts", body: post })

export const postGet = (postId: string) => request({ method: "GET", path: `/posts/${postId}` })
```

Structure and shape of each method on your own. But it should be consistent with all other requests.

> Recommended to setup imports in your project, to allow import from root (`src/`) or use some aliases.

**Good:**

```ts
import { postsList } from 'api/post'
// or
import * posts from '@api/post'
```

**Bad:**

```ts
import { posts } from '../../../api'
````
